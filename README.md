## üë®‚Äçüî¨ **About me**
My name is Ash (Ashley, Gashy, pick your poison), I am a full-stack senior developer based in the United Kingdom.

I started my development journey in **2018**, and I have been building bespoke-focused websites commercially since **2020**.

I'm always happy to try something challenging or new, so I like to keep up to date with the new developments that appear on the development scene.

## üåê **Known languages, frameworks & tools**
- HTML, CSS, JS
- PHP, WordPress, Laravel, Twig
- Node, React, Vue
- Ruby on Rails, Liquid
- MySQL, MongoDB
- SASS, Bootstrap, Tailwind

## üõ†Ô∏è **Personal projects**
### **[Leo's Legacy](https://leoslegacy.info/)**
On Jan 21<sup>st</sup> 2024, my 2-year-old son Leo sadly lost his life to Group 3 Medulloblastoma with MYC amplification - a form of brain cancer that primarily affects male infants & children (2:1 male to female), and the MYC protein amplified the progression of the tumour to a terrifying speed.

Leo was my best friend, his love knew no bounds, his bright smile would light up anyone's day, and his hilarious daily antics would make us laugh, and will forever continue to be in our memories.

When the tumour was diagnosed its progression was so fast that it took his precious soul in less than a week, a pain that broke us tremendously as parents - something no parent should ever have to live with.

Because of this, we have formed a charity in memory of Leo to raise awareness of Medulloblastoma, to help raise money towards medical research for better treatments, and to discover early detection methods.

### **[Zombacus](https://zombacus.com)**
Zombacus is a resource hub for Call of Duty: Zombies.

This was one of my very first personal projects - built with PHP, CSS and JS, it allowed me to learn the core concepts of web development and served as a stepping stone into learning other tech stacks.
